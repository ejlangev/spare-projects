## Auto Text

Code for building a text relay pushed through a single twilio number
that allows a single person to send bulk form text messages scraped
out of spreadsheets and handle responses from their actual phone
number.

Also has code for marking rows inside the spreadsheet as claimed and
saving the phone numbers to S3 for use with an AWS lambda function.
